                    value="An exception is a problem that arises during the
                    execution of a program. An exception can occur for many
                    different reasons, including the following: A user has
                    entered invalid data.A file that needs to be opened
                    cannot be found. A network connection has been lost in
                    the middle of communications or the JVM has run out of
                    memory. Some of these exceptions are caused by user
                    error, others by programmer error, and others by physical
                    resources that have failed in some manner. To understand
                    how exception handling works in Java, you need to understand
                    the three categories of exceptions: Checked exceptions:
                    A checked exception is an exception that is typically a
                    user error or a problem that cannot be foreseen by the
                    programmer. For example, if a file is to be opened,
                    but the file cannot be found, an exception occurs. These
                    exceptions cannot simply be ignored at the time of compilation.
                    Runtime exceptions: A runtime exception is an exception
                    that occurs that probably could have been avoided by
                    the programmer. As opposed to checked exceptions, runtime
                    exceptions are ignored at the time of compilation. Errors:
                    These are not exceptions at all, but problems that arise
                    beyond the control of the user or the programmer. Errors
                    are typically ignored in your code because you can rarely
                    do anything about an error. For example, if a stack overflow
                    occurs, an error will arise. They are also ignored at the
                    time of compilation.You can see hierarchy below:"/>
